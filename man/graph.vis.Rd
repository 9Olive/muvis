}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{an arbitrary graph object in R.}

\item{directed}{TRUE if the graph is directed (default = FALSE)}

\item{community}{(default = TRUE)}

\item{betweenness}{(default = TRUE)}

\item{plot}{(default = TRUE)}
}
\value{
(If plot = TRUE it plots the noninteractive graph) A list contains:
\item{graph}{an igraph object}
\item{betweenness}{betweenness measurements of each edge. (if betweenness = TRUE)}
\item{network}{a highcharter plot of the graph.}
